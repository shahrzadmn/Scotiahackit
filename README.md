# Hackit =)

- Steps:
  - Create fake data consistenting of "homes"
  - populate google maps with 1000 or so models
  - then create filters which can reactively move these markers on/off
  - suggest optimal locations + optimal mortgage
    - do so while comparing best options against each other

  - submit! =)

- we can assume that we have access to customer data
